# Description

The savvy cats over at SMART Pump would like to be able to allow users to login to their account, check their balance and update their personal details. Write a simple web application (API and UI) using node.js and lowdb that lets users accomplish those tasks. 

Feel free to use any other libraries or tool chains as long as the core code is javascript and node.js. npm (https://www.npmjs.org) is your friend - no need to recreate the wheel. 

You will find the base data file in `/data`
